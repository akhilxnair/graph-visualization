# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an interactive graph-based visualization tool designed to display cloud infrastructure security issues. The tool will provide a hierarchical view of cloud environments, accounts, and services, highlighting security alerts and misconfigurations. Users will be able to interact with the graph through features like zooming, panning, and collapsing/expanding nodes to focus on specific areas of interest.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud security engineer, I want to visualize the hierarchy of my cloud infrastructure, so that I can understand the relationships between clouds, accounts, and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a hierarchical graph showing cloud providers at the top level
2. WHEN viewing the graph THEN the system SHALL show accounts as children of cloud providers
3. WHEN viewing the graph THEN the system SHALL show services as children of accounts
4. WHEN viewing the graph THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual cues to distinguish between different node types (cloud, account, service)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to see security alerts and misconfigurations associated with each node, so that I can quickly identify problematic areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a node THEN the system SHALL display the count of alerts associated with that node
2. WHEN viewing a node THEN the system SHALL display the count of misconfigurations associated with that node
3. WHEN a node has a high number of alerts or misconfigurations THEN the system SHALL visually highlight it (e.g., with color coding)
4. WHEN hovering over a node THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with more detailed information about the alerts and misconfigurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an infrastructure manager, I want to collapse and expand parts of the graph, so that I can focus on specific areas of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a node with children THEN the system SHALL toggle between collapsed and expanded states
2. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL hide its children nodes and associated edges
3. WHEN a node is expanded THEN the system SHALL show its children nodes and associated edges
4. WHEN collapsing or expanding nodes THEN the system SHALL animate the transition for better visual understanding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the graph through zooming and panning, so that I can navigate complex infrastructure visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mouse wheel or pinch gestures THEN the system SHALL allow zooming in and out of the graph
2. WHEN dragging the graph area THEN the system SHALL allow panning to view different parts of the graph
3. WHEN the graph is larger than the viewport THEN the system SHALL maintain context and orientation during navigation
4. WHEN interacting with the graph THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance even with large datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want to see alert and misconfiguration details directly on the nodes, so that I can quickly understand security issues without navigating to a separate panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a node THEN the system SHALL display a floating information component above the node with alert and misconfiguration details
2. WHEN viewing the information component THEN the system SHALL show a breakdown of alert types and severity levels
3. WHEN viewing the information component THEN the system SHALL show a list of specific misconfigurations
4. WHEN the information component is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it appropriately to avoid obscuring other important elements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built with modern web technologies and follow best practices, so that it is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the application THEN the system SHALL use React with TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN implementing the graph visualization THEN the system SHALL use React Flow for efficient rendering
3. WHEN styling the application THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate React hooks (useState, useReducer, useMemo) for optimal performance
